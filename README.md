Trial Rooms are a must in fashion stores. It is time to revolutionize the way we look at ourselves. Smart mirrors which implements augmented reality, 3D imaging, artificial intelligence is eye- catching. A similar change could be brought in by using an Android TV and a web-cam. The latest technological trends could be displayed when the customer stands in front of the screen. Recommendations and suggestions will also lead the customer to try out new varieties and thus increasing the demands and returns. 

When a customer enters the store, it would prove tiresome to try every dress he selects. Thus, we provide a solution wherein he would stand in front of an android TV and click a picture of himself and scan the QR code of the clothes. The selected dresses are matched with the attributes of the person and using latest technologies the dress is applied on his image and a smart fashionista algorithm is developed which would suggest him which cloth would suit him better according to his complexion and size. 
A virtually applying of dress and a fashion consultant together world attract more customers and increase the demands. It would be an innovation which could be used as an advertising catch for the store. An android app which would evolve a new trend, a new revolution is our dream! 
We have built it in  Android Studio.
